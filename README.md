# Copy Memory Task üìù

### About the project üìñ

---

This project is build out 2 projects. Self implementation of LSRMcell, RNNcell and Linear layers. Self implementation of the copy memory task.<br>
The project is a university assignment in the course of mini-project in deep learning using PyTorch.<br><br>

**LSTM.py** - self implementation of lstm cell<br>
**RNN.py** - self implementation of rnn cell<br>
**MLP.py** - self implementation of linear<br><br>
